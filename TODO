General
=======

* look for data directory in more locations
* view last replay menu
* bottom foreground for game over
* puyo connection images
* rotation animation
* replays: control the size of the replay directory somehow, zip replays
* limit player name size in high scores (and allocate the string only once)
* background image(s)
* sound
* prevent puyo rotations which allow to go up a two-space high wall

Multiplayer
===========

* pause menu
* let the winners know they won
* view other players' field
* end replays

Network
=======

* timeouts
* FastOrdered does not work at all
* find out ping to change initial resend delay
* split packets which are too big
* finish sending important packets before closing
* put Channel before Connect
* change Connect to split sent and received messages (Hello and Accept)
* use TCP for important ordered channels
* replace Bin with a more general setting
* do not crash if a message cannot be read

Other
=====

* Gfx.set with arrays (using a bound on the length of effects)
* -debug option to use "d" key but no score nor replay
