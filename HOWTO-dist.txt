This file is only intended for developpers as a reminder of how to
make a release.

* Check that all text files are LICENSEd.

grep -L Copyright `darcs query manifest` | grep -v .png | grep -v .xcf         

Don't bother adding the LICENSE to very small files or files for which
licensing does not really make sense. For instance, the following
files are ok:

./HOWTO-dist.txt
./TODO
./_tags
./furypuyo.odocl
./myocamlbuild.ml
./net/Makefile
./net/_tags
./net/idea.txt
./net/network.mllib
./net/network.odocl
./server/Makefile
./server/_tags
./version.ml
./net/test1/Makefile
./net/test2/Makefile

* Check the README.

* Check that there is no new, unrecorded file.

darcs whatsnew -ls

* Open version.ml and update the version number. Usually this means:
  remove the "dev" suffix.

* Make the .tar.gz and check that it compiles and executes.

make dist
tar xf (the newly created archive)
cd (the newly created directory)
make
./furypuyo
cd ..
rm -rf (the newly created directory)

This should also be done with no ~/.furypuyo directory.

* Check the list of changes and prepare a summary.

darcs changes --from-tag x.y

* TAG the version.

darcs tag x.y

* Create a new version on the forge with the summary of changes, and
  upload the .tar.gz to the OCaml Forge.

* Anounce the new version with the summary of changes.
