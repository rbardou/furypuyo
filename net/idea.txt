Layer 1: UDP
============

Socket creation.
Sending and receiving packets.
Packets are marshalled OCaml values.

Layer 2: Connection
===================

Establish a connection.
Send and receive packets when connection is established.

Send HELLO to ask for a connection.
Repeat HELLO if needed.
Bufferize HELLO packets.
Accept connection by sending ACCEPT.
Close a connection by sending BYE.

Layer 3: Channels
=================

Send and receive packets on a channel.
Each channel can transmit a particular OCaml type.

Layer 4: Framing, Avoiding Duplicates, Flux Control, Acknowledgement
====================================================================

Callback for message acknowledgement.
Message IDs.
Framing.

Each message has an ID, incremented by exactly 1 for each message.
Acknowledge all received messages with ACKNOWLEDGE of ID.

Sending frame:
  Size NS and position PS.
  Do not send messages that are too young (ID >= PS + NS), put them in a buffer.
  Shift operation to change P, typically used by the acknowledgement callblack.
  Shift sending frame after ACKNOWLEDGED if ID = PS, to next unacknowledged.

Reception frame:
  Size NR and position PR.
  Ignore messages which are too old (ID < PR).
  Shift frame when receiving a message.
  Remember all received message IDs in the frame (PR <= ID < PR + NR).
  Ignore a message if its ID has been remembered.
  When receiving a young message (ID >= PR + NR) shift frame (PR = ID - NR + 1).

Layer 5A: Resending
===================

Can be used for important, unordered messages.

Remember all sent messages in a buffer.
Regularly resend unacknowledged messages.
Delete acknowledged messages from the buffer.

Layer 5B: Ordering
==================

Can be used for important, ordered messages.

Next ID to be received is stored in NEXT.
Remember all received but undelivered messages.
Only deliver a message if its ID is NEXT, then increment NEXT by 1.

Improvement:
  Only remember SIZE messages.
  With framing, the sender says that old messages do not matter. So, if
    SIZE is the size of the frame, all important messages are received.

Layer 5A: Forgetful Ordering
============================

Can be used for unimportant, ordered messages.

Remember the ID of the last received message in LAST.
Ignore a message if it is too old (ID < LAST).
When receiving acknowledgement of ID, shift PS to ID.

Layer 7: Abstraction
====================

Abstract everything: only a single message type.
Functions describing if a message is important and its order channel number.
