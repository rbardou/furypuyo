==============

To run Fury Puyo, you need:
- the SDL library version 1.2.

To compile Fury Puyo, you also need:
- the OCaml compiler version 3.10.2;

- Findlib

Debian or Ubuntu packages are:

        ocaml

If you prefer, you can use Godi:

Of course you can try with other versions of OCaml or SDL.
